      <h1>Problems that I faced:</h1>
      <br />
      1. It initially took me some time to understand what I have to do, whether I have to recreate the game and what
      all this type means. I end up reading the what the game is doing for more than 10 times until I realised that it
      doesn't matter. :)<br />
      2. Never used GO but always heard about it, finally get the chance to have an overview about the technology.<br />
      3. It took me couple of design iterations. I want it to be simple and minimlistic and at the same time informative
      and aspiring to be a part of the game.<br />
      4. CORS issue was a headache ended up creating proxy.conf to hit the api of the backend.<br />
      5. I never used docker compose. Usually use docker with GCP. So, It was kinda cool to create different services
      and running both app/backend from single command.<br />
      6. Getting my head around webSocket and it's implemenation had taken me to the journey of change detection in
      Angular.<br />
      7. I used to write snapshot test cases and manual test cases in the form of gherkins. So, It was exciting to learn
      about it.<br />
      8. I think the game is not working right, Sometime I faced issue where round are getting over little early. But,
      I'm not bale to reproduce the same now.<br />
      <span class="test-cases"
        >I haven't added test cases in docker run. You can simply run the test cases by running `npm run test`.</span
      >
      And the rest of the things I have updated in README.md and Documentation.

      In totatality it was a great learning experience. I get a chance to dirty my hands in different areas. I loved it.
      <br />
      My focus was on building and dividing the application into smaller components consiedring shallow domming. I
      created smaller sub-components that can be easy to use and accessible throughout the project like
      spinner/loader/modals which provide consistency and help you in fast developement on later stages. <br />
      My design is pretty simple but kinda exciting to be a part off. And I hope you guys enjoy the Flip Coin game.
      Yeah, I know and I will going to come up with some super cool name.<br />
